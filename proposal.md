# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Magic the Gather EDH up to date deck cost

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

To be able to input cards into a list that includes the card's name, set, foil/nonfoil and price to find the overall deck cost and to use it as a way to monitior cost for budget reasons.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

This will be accomplished through python. The code will include a way to be able to navigate TCGplayer to find the card and use the medium market price. This price will be recorded with the other information until the full 100 cards are recorded. The list will be outputed as a excel sheet with the total price listed and then if the price exceeds the budget amount, a flag/ note will appear

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A Good outcome is being able to have the input information (name, set, etc) and get the price from TCGplayer and put it into a list of the current price 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome is if this can be saved and repeated for multiple different decks and all can be access with the deck's price. Each list will have the total price and a flag/note if it exceeds the budget amount.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome is to input the deck list once and have a way to refresh it everytime its open for the most accurate price. Also to add a way to replace cards already listed if the deck list changed because of a new set release.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I will need to do research how to go and navigate websites to find the important information and retrieve it that I need. The new skills probably will be using new python functions that hasn't been taught in class.
